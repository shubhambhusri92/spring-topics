Spring Security - Select User Roles using Drop-Down List

Question

In the Spring Security Registration example, what if I don't want to set Role default as Employee? Instead I want to take roles from user through registration page using dropdown list.  Then I want to store role data in role table and user data in user table. How can I achieve this?

Answer

I have a solution that covers this scenario. This includes PDF description and source code.
